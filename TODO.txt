v0.1:
+ transition to LEG definition step (waypoints to legs conversion, 
  considering existing legs)
+ stepping refactor
+ legs
  + transferring leg definitions to frontend
  + transferring leg function matrices to frontend
  + drawing leg overlays (with hardcoded linear function)
  + editing leg functions
  + converting leg functions to evaluateable on frontend
  + converting leg functions to evaluateable on backend
  + draw the functions correctly
  + editable constraint points and x-values
+ bugfix of step 1: point moving did not work
+ bugfix of mapedit: resize observer does not reset top left corner
+ mapedit: moving amount is not decreasing when scaled
+ mapedit: zoom to all
+ docgen_sample.py works again
- annotations
  + basic implementation
  - add/move annotations with mouse (changing func-x-value)
  - more precise bubble estimation
- tracks
- final step: download generated files (docx, png, gpx, vfr)
  + download docx, png
  + download gpx
  + vfr format save-load
  - change dof before generation
- change to socket.io (for auto reconnect and simpler code)
- order constraint points by func_x automatically
- prepare for deploy
- mobile friendly (responsive + touch controls)
- save to cloud
