- mobile friendly: responsive
- waypoints/constraint points lon-lat editable (in degrees/minutes/seconds and decimal format)
- session management: caching of states per session to disk on each modification
- give visual feedback if no route is open on the server for the current session
- progress indication while waiting for server
- speed is modifiable in step 6
- bugfix: readonly mathedit does not show formula
- edit "function_range" on leg page
- order constraint points by func_x automatically

- bubbles' content revised/customizable
- journey log created, content revised
- colorpicker default listed colors revised (high contrast)
- bugfix: map-info width and horizontal scrolling
- consider tracks from various sources (SkyDemon, ForeFlight, GeoTracker, Garmin5)
- session management
  - limit the session connections based on available memory (or number of open sessions)
  - visual feedback if no connection available
- multiple maps (from multiple countries)
- consider place-name based waypoint selection (based on a public database)

v0.3

v0.2
+ landing page
+ memory optimizations for low-res map
  + separate data sending from image sending
  + instead of contextmanager, be explicit about figure release
  + instead of plotting the map, use Pillow based manipulation
  + send images as binary through socket (centralize receiving in frontend)
  + send smaller tiles through websocket (this will also be good for progress display)
+ bugfix: LOW_DPI dependent tiles coordinates
+ no contextmanagers for figures
+ session management: time to live for sessions in the session store (api/routes.py:_vfrroutes)
+ session management: session_id is always sent in http and ws requests (retreived from localStorage)
+ the same memory optimizations for waypoints map
+ bugfix: the last tiles (in a row, in a column) are stretched (of course: they are smaller, but this
  is not considered)
+ the same memory optimizations for legs map
+ the same memory optimizations for annotations map
+ the same memory optimizations for tracks map
+ bugfix: LOW_DPI dependent VFRPoint transformations
+ bugfix: HIGH_DPI dependent VFRPoint transformations
+ memory optimizations for final image generation
  + binary transfer of final documents (PNG, DOCX)
  + introduced a resolution for this drawing (DOC_DPI)
  + background not drawn with matplotlib, but composited with PIL
  + background done with tiling (for tiles: bg_img.paste(get_tile(0, 0), (0, 0)))
+ cacheable tiles
  + overlay rendered into svg, frontend has 3 layers: map (canvas, tiles),
    server_overlay (svg), client_overlay (canvas); figure released immediately by
    SVGRenderer (this way map tiles will be uniform)
  + high resolution tiles are rendered according to fixed grid (this is
    needed for uniform map tiles)
  + frontend clips on the side to avoid larger maps shown than requested
  + bugfix: doc generation was not updated to fixed grid
+ tile cache
  + server caches to disk and checks before creating
  + change to http get for tiles, frontend uses http cache for tiles
+ bugfix: map download needed to be put at an earlier stage
+ bugfix: api endpoint rewrote by angular to /frontend/api/..., changed to absolute url
+ mapedit: moving amount is not decreasing when scaled
+ annotations: during edit, no realtime data is downloaded, only during final generation
+ sample route is loaded from file instead of generating it in code (also tracks are included)
+ annotations: text overlay refreshed automatically after every edit (1-1,5s delay is tolerable)
  and default to not show (wrongly) estimated bubbles
+ annotations: text is english + bugfix of prev commit
+ annotations: more precise bubble estimation
+ annotations: bubbles can be moved with mouse
+ add tooltips to buttons, no tooltip for app-header
+ remove unneccessary info (XY in map info panel)
+ double-click instead of middle button
+ mobile friendly: touch controls
+ bugfix: multiple constraint points, not editable?
+ calculation of final map size: area of interest never decreased, but
  increased if some function point would go outside
+ bugfix: extent calculation directly after load (matrix and function does not exist yet)
+ save to cloud
+ save to cloud sanitizes file name, checks for max published routes
+ bugfix: edge case no waypoints -> extent calculation crashed + filename sanitization update


v0.1:
+ transition to LEG definition step (waypoints to legs conversion, 
  considering existing legs)
+ stepping refactor
+ legs
  + transferring leg definitions to frontend
  + transferring leg function matrices to frontend
  + drawing leg overlays (with hardcoded linear function)
  + editing leg functions
  + converting leg functions to evaluateable on frontend
  + converting leg functions to evaluateable on backend
  + draw the functions correctly
  + editable constraint points and x-values
+ bugfix of step 1: point moving did not work
+ bugfix of mapedit: resize observer does not reset top left corner
+ mapedit: zoom to all
+ docgen_sample.py works again
+ annotations
  + basic implementation
  + bubbles are switchable
  + add/move annotations with mouse (changing func-x-value)
  + server state is updated
  + annotation can be deleted
  + annotation can be created
  + minimum of 2 annotations included
+ tracks
  + upload track files and import it in state
  + assign colors to them
  + draw the full image with annotations and routes
+ final step: download generated files (docx, png, gpx, vfr)
  + download docx, png
  + download gpx
  + vfr format save-load
  + change dof before generation
+ auto reconnect websocket (or change to socket.io)
+ deploy
  + Dockerfile + koyeb.yaml
  + websocket path adjusted to deployed one
  + high and low resolution set from environment variable (instead if hardcoded)
  + bugfix: fixed local paths eliminated
